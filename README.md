# pirate game
### Made in collabarotion with Luke Bortot

**Summary**

This project was put together to learn how glm works. It was built as a kind of challenge to see how far we would be able to get without using outside resoures to solve graphical problems. The self imposed challenge was just a mechanism in which we used to learn about glm and graphics as a whole.

**How To**

If you wish to run the program you can simply use the command 
```g++ PirateGame.cpp -x c glad/glad.c -g -lSDL2 -lSDL2main -lGL -ldl -o tryit```

And then once it is compiled run the executable ```./tryit```

**FYI**

This project is free for anyone to use and build upon. Just make sure that not only me and Luke are marked as contributors, but the indivuals whose code we had already built upon.
